Intro to Tkinter GUI (Graphical User Interface).
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit,
 and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard GNU/Linux, 
 Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.
 I showed examples, which are intro to the Tkinter. All files will be properly described soon.
